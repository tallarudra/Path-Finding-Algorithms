# Path-Finding-Algorithms<br>
Given set of nodes and the distance between them, it finds the path between the start node and goal node using BFS, DFS, A* and UCS Algorithms.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Run the pathFinder.py file without providing any arguments. The program will ask 2 inputs from the User:<br>
    <ol><li>Name of the file present in the same directory as pathFinder.py or a relative link to the input file.<li>The algorithm to be used to compute the path. (BFS, DFS, A*, UCS - Case Sensitive).</ol><br>
